I frequently encounter terms like Blockchain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ripple, and others in the news, prompting my curiosity to explore these concepts further. This post provided an excellent starting point. As I grasped the basics, my data scientist instincts kicked in, raising several questions:

How many cryptocurrencies exist, and what are their current prices and valuations?
What has driven the recent surge in interest?
What comes next?
With the price data in hand, I sought to delve deeper into the factors influencing cryptocurrency prices. Beginning with Bitcoin, I discovered multiple parameters impacting its value. Fortunately, Blockchain Info provided data on these parameters bi-daily.

This exploration will enhance our understanding of the factors influencing Bitcoin's price and improve our ability to make future predictions beyond merely analyzing historical prices.
