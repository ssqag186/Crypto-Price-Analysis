I'm a huge fan of Blockchain, Bitcoin, and all those other buzzwords making headlines. My curiosity got the best of me, so I started diving into these concepts. This post provided an excellent starting point. As I grasped the basics, my interest for crypto kicked in, raising several questions:

How many cryptocurrencies exist, and what are their current prices and valuations? 
What has driven the recent surge in interest? What comes next?
With the price data in hand, I sought to delve deeper into the factors influencing cryptocurrency prices. Beginning with Bitcoin, I discovered multiple parameters impacting its value. Fortunately, https://coinmarketcap.com/vi/ provided data on these parameters bi-daily.
